************* mine sweeper ***********

The last thing you remember was Sarge fiddling with the balky minesweeper.
Sarge never was the placid, easy going type. More the swearing, yelling, abusive type.
And not great with mechanical things, either. His way of fixing the minesweeper was banging it hard on the ground.
In retrospect, that might not have been such a good idea. There's now a suspiciously fresh crater where Sarge was standing.
You can see it out of the one eye that's open. The other eye is, like much of you, buried in the godforsaken mud of this godforsaken field.
That sound is either rain or someone dropping gravel on your head. Probably the latter. It's competing with the loud buzzing coming from somewhere about two inches behind your eyes.


There is a battered mine sweeper here.

It needs work.
